Hi, this is the code for my website made using Gatsby!

How to start:
cd into this folder
Use "gatsby develop" to start a local server
ensure all files are downloaded from cloud server

To setup a new code sketch
Create new p5 sketch
Save to canvas size 500, 500

git changes and will push back into netlify.
