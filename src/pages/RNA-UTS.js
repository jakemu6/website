            <i>RNA x UTS || Sense of Belonging</i>
            <br /><br />
            Sense of Belonging is a campaign aimed at creating more awareness to the services available at the University of Technology Sydney. Through creative strategy and in-depth research, the team devised a strategy to create a wider sense of community, identifying key problems behind the university and its students. This greater community allows for more interaction between students to create a unified voice behind studentâ€™s feelings towards the university and its services.
            <br /><br />
            The outcome produced large banners used to share students thoughts and feelings alongside a book that details many different voices of students gratitude and ingratitude for the university. This book was printed and shared among many of the senior administrators of UTS.
            <br /><br />
            Created as part of a team including Ady Neshoda, Monica Steiner and Emma Sharp.
